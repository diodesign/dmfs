## dmfs

This is the Diosix Manifest File System (DMFS) parser and generator. It can parse DMFS images, and create DMFS images from a set of files.

This crate is used by [Diosix](https://diosix.org) to load native services and guest operating systems from firmware storage. As such, it does not require the standard library. If you wish to use this for your own project, let me know and I'll tidy up the documentation and API.
